                <h2>Raising questions under the Clouds</h2>
                <p class="article-date">June 12, 2021</p>
                <div class="article-content">
<p>Today, at 8 AM in the morning I was appreciating the beauty of the cloud and cheering the arrival of monsoon. Suddenly I heard a very painful voice saying "<em>babu-bhaiya rickshaw nahi chal rha hai, bahut bhukh pyas laga hai kuch khane ko de dijiye</em>".</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the words were not very new to me as we are living in a country where more than 600 million people are struggling to arrange food on a daily basis. But there was something different this time . I tried to ignore this voice because I had been trained with this mindset. Fair enough. I did but I failed this time although I have been doing this for years now.</p>
                        <p>What was different this time? A seventy five year old man who possessed the skill of pulling rickshaw had to beg just because there was no one to use his service. This time it was not just a yet another begger in my street rather he seemed to me representing a new class of people who has been forced to drop their self respect and beg for survival due to the COVID-19. His voice was raising a number of indirect questions. Won't you hear our voices deaf? Will you still ignore? Have you ever faced such situation? Would you expect the same behavior, unfortunately if you face the same situation? And many more.</p>
                        <p>Admitting myself to be an incapable individual with no answer to that old man, thought to ask few questions to our so called society. Asking question on top of a question is the easiest escape from the answer. This is something I learned from the government of the day. But anyway, let me raise few.</p>
                        <p>Most of us are criticizing government for the precarious situation of that old man. But are we not equally share the causes of the precarious situation of that old man? Are we not forgetting the days when people(we used to call them labour class) had to walk thousands of kilometre, sleep on railway tracks after getting tired in the journey and then never waking up to see the failure of our government and society?</p>
                        <p>"<em>Its never too late</em>". If there are 600 million people struggling in our country then at the same time at least 200 million are free from daily struggle(this doesn't include the struggle for luxury). Can't these 200 million be the voices for these 600 million? I hope some day this will happen and I won't have to hear and ignore the voice of a 75 year old man begging for food in our country.</p>
