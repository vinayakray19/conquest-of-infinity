                <h2>The Goldmine</h2>
                <p class="article-date">October 22, 2024</p>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>At times, you know, you have probably hit the gold mine. The mine which can be mined by every possible individual. The mine which has limitless availability. Yet, you just don&#8217;t know how to make everyone believe the same. Something, which has the potential to turn everyone into an alchemist.</p>
                    <p><br />Yet, let me give it a try. Probably the reinforcement by yet another individual could do the magic. But before moving any further, let me quote few greats across history.</p>
                    <p><br />The Buddha said &#8220;<em>The mind is everything. What you think, you become&#8221;.</em></p>
                    <p><br />Gandhi Ji said &#8220;<em>change your mind, change the world&#8221; </em>And &#8220;<em>before you wish to change the world, change yourself</em>&#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br />The Great Roman Emperor and Philosopher Marcus Aurelius said &#8220;<em>The quality of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts</em>&#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br />The Former US President Theodore Roosevelt said &#8220;<em>Believe you can and you are halfway there</em>&#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br>Last but not the least, The Bharat Ratna APJ Kalam emphasized in his book Ignited Minds &#8220;<em>Dream, Dream and Dream</em>&#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br />If we will observe carefully and try to connect the dots, the commonality among all the saying is the emphasis upon THE POWER OF MIND and THE THOUGHTS.</p>
                    <p><br />Diverse religion accross the globe, Hinduism to Buddhism and Christianity to Islam have also constantly emphasized upon the power of mind and the thoughts. For example, culturally in almost every hindu family, at some point or the other our mother must have taught that &#8220;negative baaten nahi bolte hain, jiva pe maa saraswati rahti hain&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t found any subtler way to teach the power of mind and this is essentially the beauty of any religion to turn even the most complex things into a daily practice.</p>
                    <p><br />Anyway, if you are not a religious person, believe me there is a good news for you as well. The science confirms the same today. The neuroscientists like Jerry Konorski have coined the term Neuroplasticity which essentially means the power of thoughts to rewire the hardwired neural networks. The same has been explained in detail by Norman Doidge in his book &#8220;The Brain that Changes itself &#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br>I am not sure if you are still convinced. Let me ask one not so frequently asked question. Why and How Hitler was able to turn himself into a monster without any guilt? How can a person be so brutal and yet have no guilt at all? Even the closest allies of Hitler, like Hess, refused to plead guilty after the end of World War2. Why is it so? How did he accomplish this? The most simple answer that crosses my mind &#8220;his ability to control his thoughts&#8221;. It is a different debate that he used this for destruction rather than creation.</p>
                    <p><br />You, still, don&#8217;t believe me. So let us think, why on Earth, Elon Musk is able to think and accomplish things that we are not even able to imagine, forget about accomplishing? What is the key Differentiator? Even if there are multiple possible factor for this, one has to be his ability to think and think big.</p>
                    <p><br />There is enough evidences available in every possible sphere of life. The key is to observe and observe them carefully. How on earth can someone like Michael Jordan be born, who simply changed the meaning of Consistency and Accuracy. How on earth, can a person like Michel Phelps exist whose total gold medal count in Olympics is more than a country&#8217;s total gold medal tally in HISTORY of Olympics which is home to more than 1.4 billion population. What made them achieve all of this, apart from their genetics? The way they thought about themselves <em>knowingly or unknowingly</em>. As simple as this.</p>
                    <p><br />I hope till this point, you may have been convinced to some degree that there is something with the power of thoughts and mind. The conviction takes time and experience to cultivate the same.</p>
                    <p><br>But, are the thoughts only factor? No. I don&#8217;t subscribe to this idea with the given amount of understanding I have. Just Imagine, if the King of the 100 and 200 meter sprint, the Usain Bolt being born in the Apartheid era. The era plagued by complete racism in Africa. Hardly anyone on this planet would have realized his potential as far as I could imagine. Yet, at the same time I certainly believe that these factors are not in anyone&#8217;s control. So let&#8217;s go with the old saying &#8220;<em>Control the Controllable</em>&#8220;.</p>
                    <p><br />Till this point, you would have imagined the power of thoughts and the limitation of the external factors with me but there is one question that still remains in your headspace. <em>Can we all really shape these thoughts on our own? If yes, how can we achieve that?</em></p>
                    <p><br />I happen to find the answer of this question in the book, <em>The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle</em>. So here is the simple way suggested by him, which is quite evident in the title of his book &#8220;Utilise the potential of NOW to shape the thoughts&#8221;. You have all the right to get angry. But this is what it is.</p>
                    <p><br />I am leaving you baffled with the question, <em>How to utilize the power of now to shape the thoughts</em>. If you are really trying to turn yourself into an alchemist, this much is expected off you. One can be taken to the pond but cannot be forced to drink.</p>
                    <p><br>So if you are willing to mine the goldmine of the power of mind, just carry and utilise the power of now as the tool. <em>But the most important, before utilising the tool, go and learn the tool first.</em></p>
                    <p><br />Best of luck from just another miner.</p>
