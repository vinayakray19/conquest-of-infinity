<p>There was a kid, who knew nothing about dreams. He grew up within uncertain time and condition. Even the smallest of things seemed to be impossible for him.</p>
                        <p>The kid grew over time however the long spell of darkness was just not ending. Suddenly on some beautiful day, the light appeared and he was roaring with the sense of joy. He had achieved something significant in his life and started to believe in himself so much so that everything started to look possible.</p>
                        <p>You know the desire, it simply multiplies. The kid also could not hold his desires and decided to choose a path which seemed just not difficult but foolish. Well wishers tried to warn him but the kid was too confident about himself.</p>
                        <p>The new journey of kid was filled with joy however the downturn came. He was back to square one. He was now desperate to turn the clock behind but there was no way of doing this. He began to doubt himself and started to feel guilty about his decisions. But the clock had moved too far ahead.</p>
                        <p>The spell of darkness had arrived yet again. But the kid realized it soon that it all began from here only and just the full circle had completed. The time was to step up and begin the journey yet again.</p>
                        <p>The kid moved on thinking "Dream are too costly but they are worth paying off".</p>
