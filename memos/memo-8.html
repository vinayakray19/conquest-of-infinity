<p>If not all, at least people belonging to Bihar heard the news BPSC(one of the most respected recruiter for the highest office of administration in the state) 67th CCE paper <em>YET AGAIN</em> got leaked and Exam was invalidated. This isn't something new. There has been similar discrepancies in the recent past with other exams such as SSC and railways.</p>
                        <p>Before moving ahead, let us try to understand the importance of government services in a state like Bihar based on my little experience. Bihar, a state which has limited resources but extremely talented people. The limited resource is even further limited in terms of employment opportunities. The opportunities in the formal sector is almost negligible outside government services. Now the talented students are left with one and only one option to clear the cut off for the government exams, if at all don't want to become a migrant labour.</p>
                        <p>As we have taken a look at the importance of the exam, let us try to understand the different set of students appearing for this. First set of students although small in number belongs to the well off, but we won't discuss about them as they are capable enough to take a stand for themselves.</p>
                        <p>Let's try to understand the feeling of other set of students who has limited economic or social support. They go to sleep almost daily with the same dream of changing the life on the day of exam. They think all the sleepless nights will be worth when they will come out of their exam centre. They try to feel every possible evening that this attempt will be the last one. They stop tears believing that this attempt will bring end to all the miseries of the family.</p>
                        <p>But but but…self belief gets shattered on the day of examination by cancelling the exam, for no fault of the students. Such a shame and lack of compassion from the such a respected bureaucratic setup. I don't know how do they expect the new entrants to administer with integrity if they can't even maintain the integrity at the highest levels of recruitment. But anyway I am neither an expert in administration nor I am concerned about the integrity too much.</p>
                        <p>Being a student in general, I could sense and feel the kind of emotion the aspirants would be going through. I believe, this sort of negligence in the administration is unacceptable and the corrupt should be discharged from the office and the examination should be re-conducted at the earliest. Now I could relate with the words of my dad <em>"beta iss bhir se jaldi nikal gaye, nahi toh log roj piss rahe hain"</em>. I hope these words will become irrelevant some day but not at least today.</p>
