                <div class="article-content">
<p>Finally, the year 2020 comes to it's end and this is the time to look back into the year and analyze the few important events even though the past one year has been extremely tough for the humanity itself.</p>
                        <p>The year witnessed three extremely painful events. First in the series was Delhi riot. Most of us may find difficult to remember the consequences of the riots. No matter what caused the riot to occur, but one thing is pretty much clear that the riots left its scars on secularism in Delhi. People, who had nothing to do with the cause of riot, lost their property and even life.</p>
                        <p>Even before things could settle down, the second and the most dangerous ghost of the year was knocking the door of India by the most infamous word of the year CORONA. The ghost was capable enough to push the panic button in a 1.6 billion people country. The country which was already facing the poverty, lack of primary health care facilities, unemployment and on top of all a slowing down economy was hardly in any position to deal with the ghost. Thanks to the Govt decision to announce a complete lockdown just 4 hours before enforcing the lockdown to aggravate the misery.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of the sudden lockdown is still fresh with the images of people walking hundreds of km on the national highways, loosing life while resting on the railway tracks(how much one can get tired that the horn and the noise of the running train become insignificant while paasing over the body of a resting person on the track) and the most expected one was the already troubling economy got it's reason to get into the trouble.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, the time passed. CORONA cases kept on rising even though there was complete lockdown and some extremely scientific measures were taken by the Honourable PM such as Thali Bajana and 9 Baje 9 Diya. The more the number of ghost increased, more and more it became part of the society and started to loose it's relevance as the government decisions left people with two choices 1.die due to hunger 2. Die fighting against corona. People found good chances in surviving while fighting with corona, hence took second option.</p>
                        <p>The wait for corona vaccine is yet to over, but seems like end of the tunnel is not so far. But the year was still left with some more drama. Suddenly the year seems to be ending where it started i.e. lack of trust in the government in at least a section of the population. Beginning of the year, Muslims protested against CAA which later on somehow took the shape of a riot. End of 2020, farmers protesting against some bills passed by the parliament which the farmers call as anti farmer.</p>
                        <p>HOPE could probably be the leading word towards 2021. Hope to get a vaccine. Hope to revive the image of "unity in diversity". Hope to have a trustful government which will find the end of the tussle between farmer and government. Last but not the least, Hope to get back to normal. With all the Hopes wish us all a HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021</p>
