                <h2>Lost yet Found</h2>

                <div class="article-content">
<p>There was a girl named Vidya, light hearted and joyful. She had her own aspirations and ambitions. Yet, fate had probably other plans. She got married just after giving the class eleventh examination. That too in a patriarchal family. But the husband was caring and loving. Three years after the marriage, she gave birth to a baby boy.</p>
                        <p>One day she was completely lost in her thoughts. The mundane life was making her feel jailed. All the ambitions were probably transferred to the next life. And no one was there to share all this, not even her husband. Soon the thoughts turned into painful thoughts and the pain began to find their way to the outside world through her eyes. The drop of tears in no time reached her cheeks.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly, she realized there was the tender and soft hand trying his best to wipe away the tear and at the same time trying all possible ways in his capacity to make her feel better.</p>
                        <p>She was deeply touched to see this and in no time she had probably found the purpose of her life to be alive and joyful yet again.</p>
