                <h2>Significance of Independence</h2>

<p>15th Aug 1947, the birth of India as an Independent and Sovereign nation. We are celebrating the 74th birthday of our nation and this day is a matter of proud as well as an opportunity to unravel the meaning of Independence.</p>
                        <p>Maya Angelou an American poet and civil right activist said "Independence is a heady draft, and if you drink it in your youth, it can have the same effect on the brain as young wine does. It does not matter that its taste is not always appealing. It is addictive and with each drink you want more". We are blessed that we are born in an era of Independence. But what we lacked on the other hand is the bitter taste of restraint. One could understand the utmost importance of something in its scarcity. There could not have been any better opportunity than the present COVID19 crisis to understand the importance of Independence.</p>
                        <p>As a measure of precaution, the entire country is going through some or the other forms of lockdown. So how does the lockdown has impacted our Independence? Technically, this has just restricted one of the fundamental right "freedom of movement". But the impact on the society could be observed in almost all forms to some extent. We saw the labour class walking on National highways and losing life in the fear. The domestic violence, depression and frustration are at its peak and there is no surprise that the economy is trembling. Mind it, there could be multiple reasons for the mentioned problem but one of them is the restricted movement.</p>
                        <p>Today, in the middle of restrictions which has just been imposed as a precautionary measure, the importance of Independence is more tangible and demands a lot of respect and cheer from us for all the freedom fighters and soldiers standing on the border to make this possible for us. Let's celebrate the 74th birthday of our Nation and stand with her in the time of crisis firmly.</p>
