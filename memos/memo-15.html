                <div class="article-content">
<p>India bundled out for 46 and in turn New Zealand hammering with 402 which means a lead of 356 runs in a test match. Over and above this is happening on the Indian soil, the same place where Indian cricket team is considered a different beast all together. So what went wrong with the Beast?</p>
                        <p>In my humble opinion, it is just the domino effect. One bad decision in reading the pitch and the condition. Rest just kept on falling one after the other. The ball wasn't doing as much as it started do it in their mind. This is what we call as pressure. The pressure of being the best. The pressure of playing on the home soil. The pressure of being criticized. And many such more deamons begins to fill the headspace. This ultimately leads to poor decision making, loosing the self believe and getting caged into once own mind. Does something similar happen to us on daily basis?</p>
                        <p>Isn't the simple answer is yes? We generally tend to take some risks in our life. We may have analyzed the situation before jumping into the ocean of uncertainties. However, more often than not, we tend to realize that we have completely misunderstood the challenges that our risks could have brought. And here begins the domino effect in our personal life.</p>
                        <p>We begin to possibly question every thing. The overanalysis suddenly kicks in. The mind begins to turn restless. The anxiety finds their way to the headspace. And ultimately we find ourselves caged in our own mind. But what is the point in discussing about all this stuff when the story was about the Indian cricket team?</p>
                        <p>Just to learn and understand that it's normal. It's normal that we are feeling this way if things ain't going our way. We ain't alone in this. Even the best and the toughest mind in the world feels the same way. So there is no reason to be too critical about ourselves. But the most critical question is "how to overcome this"?</p>
                        <p>The attitude towards life seems to matter the most in such condition. Considering that "The past is a place to learn from but not a place to live in" can make things much easier. Rohit's press conference was so inspiring in that sense. He simply did two things. First, the acceptance that he made a mistake in reading the condition. Second, he said "everyone has a bad day at work and we must learn and move on". This sort of attitude towards life probably makes him one of the most successful captain in the Cricketing circuit. This sort of a mindset makes the Indian team the BEAST they are.</p>
                        <p>So, I firmly believe that the Team India will make a strong comeback and as I am penning this down Indian batting unit seems to be hammering the blackcaps. Let's see how the match goes. But we must not forget this non-fictious story when we are sitting right under the tree of so called "failures" and questioning our decisions in life.</p>
