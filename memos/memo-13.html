                <h2>Failure, Fear and Counter</h2>
                <p class="article-date">May 18, 2024</p>
                <div class="article-content">
<p>Recently I read, 7 girls committed suicide after being "failed" post the declaration of class tenth results in Telangana. On the other hand, I saw a movie yesterday, SRIKANT, based on the life of Bollant Industries founder and CEO Srikant Bolla who has been blind since his birth. This raises serious questions in my headspace. What is the reason that causes one to succumb while other to break all the limits? Where is the problem? In society or within us? And many more. So I thought of penning down my learning on this.</p>
                        <p>First, why did the girls attempted suicide? On the surface it may look like if it was the failure that forced such thoughts to arrive. But, then the same should have worried the blind Srikant as his birth itself was a failed attempt by the Almighty(Or whoever is the creator). Srikant was born assumed to be begging for his entire life by the people around him and he ended up getting into most prestigious Institution of the world, the MIT, in spite of facing extreme amount of hurdle at every stage. Fought the court case to even get an admission into the Science stream post class 10th. So the argument of FAILURE seems to be misleading.</p>
                        <p>What's next then? FEAR seems to be next in the line. And this has convinced me more than anything else. The fear can manifest in different forms. The girls might have been feared by the fact "log kya kahenge". Although "Log ko jo kehna hai wo toh wo waise bhi kahenge". Still this thought is the most scary one. This simply takes off the self confidence and makes one feel completely empty from within. One begins to fall in the swirl of thoughts. They begin to feel worried about every single thing that could possibly happen like how would my parents feel, how would my friends react, will I be left behind, am I not good enough, am I causing the suffering for all, am I making the life worse for the people around me, don't I know anything and the domino effect continues.</p>
                        <p>I read it at many places "what you think is what you become" or "change the mind, change the world". But it took me a lot of time to understand the meaning of it. We suffer much more in our imagination than the reality. And this is caused by the way we think. Srikant probably never gave too much attention to the thought ki "log kya kahenge". He was probably pretty sure that nothing worse could happen than being blind by birth. One of the dialogue from the movie touched my heart "Main andha hoon bhag toh sakta nahi, toh ladne ke alawa aur koi option nahi hai". This was the same as Fight Or Flight and he choose to fight while the girls of Telangana took the flight approach under misguidance and distressed condition. I may sound a bit insensitive but this is just a perspective.</p>
                        <p>What's the solution then? Shape the thoughts. But the question is how? Believing in the self that no matter what would come along the way, we will cherish every single hurdle. Some, we will cross while in other we will be forced to fall, but we will grow stronger and stand again to face the next hurdle without giving heed to "log kya kahenge". This is all about making others believing on your idea and not the other way around. "Kyuki sabka sunne ka time nahi hai na. Kitna sunega bhai".</p>
                        <p>Just imagine if people will begin to believe that if someone fails in the standard 10th has very high probability of becoming a great entrepreneur, the stigma around failure would vanish like anything. The idea may look bizzare but just think for a second don't people say that if you will be the dropout from the college the chance are you may end up becoming next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. I am not saying if it is right or wrong but this is the talk in the top tech school. From where did it came? Some nuts like Gates and Zukerbergs made all of us believe in their idea.</p>
                        <p>So the day we fail or fall, we must ask ourselves one and only one question, did I gave my best? If not, then why? Find the reason, there has to be one. If we gave our best, just pat on our back and say we did brilliant irrespective of the results and look for the next journey to begin.</p>
                        <p>The life should be lived on our terms and not on someone else's if we have the privilege to go for that. The thought of quitting stems from our inability to take the path we wish to. We don't feel stressed in bringing earth and heaven close in impressing someone we love and this applies to life in general.</p>
                        <p>So at the end we must remember that FEAR stems from NEGATIVITY and NEGATIVITY further fuels the FEAR. The cycle continues like a spiral and takes us to suffering in our imagination. Hence the counter to break the cycle is to seed the POSITIVE and CREATIVE thoughts. POSITIVITY takes down the FEAR and we are back to this beautiful world which may be full of suffering but ladden with many inspirational examples of overcoming it in every possible dimension. Try it, and conquer the self.</p>
