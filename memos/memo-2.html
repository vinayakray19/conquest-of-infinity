                <h2>Learn To Learn</h2>
                <p class="article-date">August 4, 2020</p>
                <div class="article-content">
<p>Learning an art, sounds simple, consumes ample amount of time and energy to build. The basic yet highly potent, which could help to build anything and everything on top of it. An old saying "high buildings needs very strong bases". Although the saying may be quite old but the relevance is as good as it was thousands of years ago.</p>
                        <p>What makes the human being different from others on this tiny planet is brain and it's potential. But there is gap between the brain and it's potential which needs to be filled. Learning to learn acts as the bridge between the two. Again sounds simple but if that was the case, there was no reason of such diversity. Caution, not talking about the diversity in race, religion, region and caste! Will talk about these some other day as every division in itself is a point of debate.</p>
                        <p>Diversity means in this context the different intellectuals of our society. So why should we discuss about different intellectual of our tiny planet? To understand how the different learning leads to different outcomes. Let's take the two very well known figure in world's media 1. Elon Musk 2. Abhijit Banerjee. The comparison between the two may sound comparing Apples with Oranges, but will try to make sure that this is not the case.</p>
                        <p>Mr Elon Musk, an entrepreneur of the decade whereas Nobel Prize winner Dr Abhijeet Banerjee, one of the finest economist of the decade. One could argue with the narrow mind that even if the entire asset of Dr Banerjee will be taken together will hardly be able compare with the Mr Musk. Then one needs to understand that learning is for earning but the earning isn't limited in scope of currency rather the scope is very wide. Keeping everything aside let's try to understand the similarity between the two. Both of them have learnt with a vision.</p>
                        <p>A common vision, to serve the needs of society. This common vision of the two is common for all the intellectuals. We have discussed this to understand the flaw in our approach of learning to learn. We learn to earn but without understanding the scope of earning. Most often, the earnings are evaluated in dollars which raises so many questions. Can we measure the knowledge in currency? Do we even need to think in this direction? The Values isn't enough in itself?</p>
                        <p>Anyway, the comparison at least showed us the gap where we as a society needs to give a thought. Learning to learn could bridge the gap and take out the immense potential.</p>
