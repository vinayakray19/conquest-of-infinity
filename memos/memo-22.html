<p>Conceive an idea and nurture it for long enough. You will realize the pain of not seeing your brain child reaching to it's true potential.</p>
                        <p>This will help you to understand the pain, the parents feel, when their childrens deviate from their path. As the conceivers of an idea have no vested interest except taking it to its true potential, so are the parents.</p>
                        <p>Parents may seem to be too rude to their childrens. But, my dear friends, they just want to protect their childrens from the bitter experiences and nothing else.</p>
                        <p>The beauty of the family system is highly underestimated and undervalued. Let's try our best to preserve this beauty.</p>
                        <p>One last observation before letting you go. When we were a child, Parents didn't threw us into the dustbin, if we were crying for useless things. Rather they stayed patient and allowed themselves to go through sleepless nights.</p>
                        <p>So, if we have grown up and may see the world better than them. It's only because of them. They pushed us beyond their capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Let's say, now, they are crying for so called useless things in our view. Should we not be a little bit patient and hold their hands to see the beautiful world that we see? Anyway, who wish to see the beauties of the world alone. Let's ask ourselves, can we be a little bit tolerant to the "nuisance" Of our parents as they were with us in our childhood??</p>
                        <p>At the end, thanks a lot for coming along with me this far and listening to me so patiently. And sorry, if I made any remarks that possibly made you feel bad.</p>
