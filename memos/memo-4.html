                <h2>Comedy, Media and Priority</h2>

<p>During the lockdown, I have so much time that my entire list of stand up comedy on you tube got exhausted. Hence was looking for some replacement without putting too much money and landed up watching evening and prime time debates on news channel.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I was enjoying the news debate, read somewhere that "print and broadcasting media is the fourth pillar of democracy". The sentence seemed quite confusing to me as the current media in particular broadcasting media seems to be the fourth pillar of NAMO G Govt.</p>
                        <p>Although I may not be able check all the boxes of being a responsible citizen but I still believe that one cannot be so dumb to understand the priority. Let me try to make my statement simple. If someone in my family is dying due to consumption of drugs, will I go to ask him/her first that why did you consumed drugs or will I save him/her first and later on will try to make him understand the root cause of this?</p>
                        <p>The question is quite simple, is it the priority of the media to deal with someone who took drugs two years back or is taking at the time when the entire world is going through pandemic? The trembling economy, loss of lives of daily wage workers on railway lines, job losses of millions and agitation of farmers aren't enough to attract the attention of so called fourth pillar of democracy?</p>
                        <p>I am neither advocating for drug peddlers nor for its consumers. But we live in a world where almost every resource is scarce and the time that all of us are facing makes it more important to use the resources in prudent and prioritised manner.</p>
