                <h2>A Story of NOT so Special</h2>
                <p class="article-date">November 2, 2022</p>
                <div class="article-content">
<p>At times, it's worth sharing some story which otherwise may go unnoticed. The story begins somewhere around Dec 2020. After a long duration I got the chance to meet my childhood friend X during Dec 2020. I never saw him so dejected, it was so disheartening to see him in that situation. He was numb, walking like a dead soul. The question is why so?</p>
                        <p>Before answering the reason for the low time, let us look at his background. Mr X completed his B.Tech in the year 2017, came out of campus without a job like many of us. He went to Banglore, but could not find a job and had to return back to his home town due to financial reasons. Stayed in his home town for almost 2 and half years.</p>
                        <p>So we are back to Dec 2020. As most of us know, we are generally valued based on the amount of money we generate. His joint family was no different. Although he was trying his best to obey the elders and be a good lad, yet he was constantly been cursed by his extended family. One day in Dec 2020, some argument happened and was beaten by his so called uncle to almost death and was asked to leave the home immediately. Being a person with high degree of self respect, he decided to leave his home town the same day. I met him after this incident. So, here ends the first part of his story. Let's move the calender by almost 4 months.</p>
                        <p>He arranged some money from his friend and went to Banglore again in March 2021. Let me remind two things here, he was having gap of almost 4 years and it was time of COVID19. The arranged money was only sufficient for a month of survival. So he had to get some job immediately for the survival. Since he had no choice, so was able to get a non tech job. I received his call in that day, he was sensing the relief as the threat to survival was contained. But certainly there was something more and different this time. I have known him for almost 15 years, could see the change. He desperately wanted to prove his worth. So here comes the last part of the story.</p>
                        <p>"kaun kehta hai aasman me surakh ho nahi sakta, ek pathar toh tabiyat se ucchal ke dekho yaaron". Mr X was working a 9 hour non tech job and he needed at atleast a diploma diploma degree to cover the gap, else it was almost impossible to get into to the IT world. Now there were 2 problems i.e. money and time. He was short of both. To solve the problem of money, his two college mates came forward. Yet the time was the issue. He joined CDAC banglore. Morning class and night job.</p>
                        <p>Today I received his call, the voice from the other end said "bittu ho gaya yaar". Its difficult to put in words the emotions he was going through. But I learned few essential things. First, we should avoid judging someone based on just his current monetary earnings. Second, success should not just be measured in terms of outcome. As in case of Mr X, getting a job may not be a big deal for many but for him it was the efforts of sleepless nights along with so many other insecurities. Last but not the least, no matter who you are, where you are and how you are, the day you decide to give everything for something, you will definitely find that something some day.</p>
