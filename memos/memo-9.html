                <h2>Time, a best medicine indeed!</h2>

<p>21st March 2020, the date of Junta Curfew announcement. People ran to the railway stations to find a way to reach to their near and dear ones. Many reached but for sure not all. Difficult time demand extreme things and so did the people do. Took a decision to travel 1000s of kilometer on foot and bicycle. It made a lot of headlines in print and broadcasting media but it didn't took much time before the people started to forget about loss of lives of people resting on railways tracks. Probably we were too busy with our problems and anyway time is the best medicine. But few things are not supposed to be passed just as a mere good or bad event rather demands constant questioning of the event. Unfortunately we tend to use time as medicine and just forget.</p>
                        <p>Soon enough the deadliest demon was waiting on the doors to cause one the most unprecedented humanitarian crisis, so called second wave of COVID. This time it was month of April 2021, I know most of us remember yet I mentioned if someone don't… The masala for the media was ready. But this time it was probably an attempt of equalizer by nature if not equal. Irrespective of race, religion, caste, creed etc, everyone started to fall short to complete the life. Villages and towns started to seem like a graveyard. One of the most uncommon situation emerged i.e hate for the dear mobile phones and social media. Each and every phone call was a message associated with some or the other soul probably not resting in peace. The same social media, which we just keep on scrolling to find about the others life, became a place to be frightened of. Suddenly life became the exception and death started to look so real and close. Children lost their parents, parents lost their children and in some cases there was no one left to define who lost whom. The prayer to any and every god was the mercy of life. There couldn't have been any worse experience to understand the importance of being just alive, demanding nothing else. The belief of end to this was itself ending. But but but, as we know time is the all weather medicine.</p>
                        <p>Currently this is the mid-2022, things have settled a bit, life is getting back to its lively nature and as more and more time will pass, the memories will fade and COVID would become part of the history books. Indeed, time is the best medicine! But this entire phase left few permanent scars and even more importantly few fundamental questions that is looking for an answer such as if the life is so uncertain that nature could take it away with a blink of an eye, why can't we live in satisfaction that we are alive given that we posses sustainable source of livelihood? Ain't we more fortunate than others already? Probably the questions are easy but the answer may not be. Questions may sound philosophical but I believe many of us were praying for just the mercy of life during second wave. Lets hope, time will heal these questions as well.</p>
