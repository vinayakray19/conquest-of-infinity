                <h2>More than the Medal Fight</h2>
                <p class="article-date">August 7, 2024</p>
                <div class="article-content">
<p>Few months ago, the Police was dragging a lady with her other friends from the Jantar Mantar. People were saying the lady and her friends were the Olympians. I said, ok. But why are they protesting? The answer from the media came "political vendetta". However, few people said they are fighting for the DIGNITY. What dignity man? They said the Olympians along with other sports persons were Sexually Abused by the Chief of the Wrestling federation. Yes, you got it right. I am talking about The VINESH Phogat and the IMPOTENT Chief of the Federation. On the eve of a Remarkable victory by Vinesh in the Paris Olympics, I thought to pen down the journey to her victory.</p>
                        <p>So, The protest against sexual abuse went on for months but she faced allegation and criticism from many places. I won't deny the fact that there were enough people sympathetic about her protest as well. But here comes the most fundamental question. Did the issue had any space for divisive opinion? I don't think so. One of the most Decorated Sports Women of the country was on the roads against an infamous politician alleging the case of Sexual Abuse. She must be knowing that when the media will cover the issue, the same news would reach to her Parents and Guardians as well. Who on earth wants to expose such vulnerability. Yet the Media and People in Power did questioned the Vinesh and Other protesters Integrity.</p>
                        <p>The victim was turned into the culprit. Vinesh and her friends felt so helpless that they decided to throw all the earnings of their life, THE MEDALS and THE AWARDS, into the river. Yet, the alleged Impotent Chief of the Federation continued to represent us in the Parliament. Even his son got the Ticket from the Ruling party in the recent Lok Sabha Election. But thanks to the conscience of the people who made him loose the election.</p>
                        <p>Among all these chaos, VINESH was being cornered in every possible manner. But salute to her mental fortitude. In spite of being defeated by the system, she decided to not give up and prove in the only manner she possibly could, i.e. fighting and winning the Olympics medal on the wrestling mat for the same Nation which caused her to be dragged on the streets of Delhi.</p>
                        <p>But the Journey was never meant to be easy. People in power tried in every possible manner to ensure that she should not qualify for Paris Olympics. But at the same time this is undeniable that there are nice people within the system as well who helped her in all possible manner. At the end, the good prevailed and she qualified for the Paris Olympics in spite of the hurdles like Rehab from ACL injury and cutting down 20% of the body weight to fit into the 50 kg category.</p>
                        <p>But this was supposed to be just the beginning. The biggest monster came post the draw was announced. The first bout was against the World No 1 and reigning Olympic champion Yui Susaki who hadn't lost a single bout in the last 5 years of her wrestling carrier.</p>
                        <p>However as the saying goes "who has a why to live, can bear any how" was on display. Vinesh defeated the world No 1 in the final 20 seconds of the bout and suddenly everyone was shocked with her presence. The desperation to win the medal was so vivid in her eyes. Every single drop of tear post the win against Yui Susaki was saying so many things. It was MORE THAN THE MEDAL FIGHT. It felt like she was ready to put her life on the line. She was probably considering her defeat as the defeat of every voice in the country who wish to rise but are certainly quite due to fear.</p>
                        <p>Post the win against World No 1, she simply looked undefeatable in the road to the final. By no stretch of imagination she seems to be satisfied with the silver and she would throw every bit of her blood and sweat to make it a gold tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>However, we must introspect in this moment of joy. How is it to be Vinesh Phogat? What would be going through her mind? Didn't she deserved better from the country? Is everyone as courageous as her? If not, then what about them?</p>
                        <p>No matter what would be the result of the final, this Olympic medal of Vinesh is going to inspire many to battle for their dignity. Thanks a lot Vinesh Phogat for showing such great amount of grit, determination and mental fortitude. We bow to your feet.</p>
