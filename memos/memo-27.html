                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Rosy was giggling from the next cubicle. Harshi was asking someone a question. And a band of newly joined college grads were talking as loudly as they could without giving heed to their surroundings. Some were feeling irritated, some joyful while many were just moving with the flow. This is how our office was a few days back. A place where we were reaching with same enthusiasm every single day.</p>
                    <p><br>Now we have reached closer to the end of year. Most of them are on vacation except few. There is an awkward silence on the floor of the office. The things that once seemed irritating now seem to be missing. The days are getting longer for people visiting the same place. Although nothing has changed. The high rise building, the symmetrical complex, the food court, the trees and the roads : everything is there. Yet everything seems to be empty as the humans are missing.</p>
                    <p><br>This makes me ponder, what is it that makes an office, an office. Or for that matter even a life, a life. The human seems to be the most apt answer. Even if the place would have not been as sophisticated as the offices are, yet if a bunch of people with kind intent sit together, would make the same place heaven.</p>
                    <p><br>Anyway, the sannata of office will end soon as the new year is soon to begin. The chuckling and giggling will return to its place. The emptiness will be filled with joy again. The life will again be back to these glass houses. And move on once again.</p>
