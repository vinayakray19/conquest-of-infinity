                <div class="article-content">
<p>Just few days have passed and the voice has started to go down. I was trying to think, had I been either the victim or the kin of victim, What would I be thinking? Although it would be a grave mistake or rather crime to say that I can understand, what she and her family would be going through. Yet I want to feel what all could possibly come to my mind, just thinking about the incident.</p>
                        <p>She was living in a society and country, where everyone might have told her that women is as good as goddess. She was conditioned with such thought and never saw what was coming. No body probably told her that this planet is full of animals in human faces and the moment they get the chance, begin to showcase their true colors. But the true colors can't be hidden for too long and so the animals came and hunted.</p>
                        <p>Now I have few very basic questions to ask. First, had she been my sister or mother, I would have reacted the same as I am doing it now? Had I been satisfied with the way the so called countrymen and women reacted to it?</p>
                        <p>Second, why do we just talk about morality? Is it just the defense mechanism of weak people? Can anyone dare to talk to that women about peace, harmony, love, tolerance blah blah? Does all of it not seem to be too hollow.?</p>
                        <p>Third, although I respect every women but have we seen anything wrong happening with the family of people in power. I haven't heard, may be others have. Doesn't powerlessness seems to be at the core of what happened with her?</p>
                        <p>Now the last question creates a vicious cycle. If one seeks to be powerful, naturally there will be others who will have to surrender under power. Those who surrender, would be exploited and they would try to turn the table. And it just keeps on going. The circle of triumph, exploitation and revenge keeps on going. At the end, the looser is always the humanity.</p>
                        <p>Although I am neither trying to justify what happened with her nor want to sound insensitive, but the truth is the incident with the women is neither the first heinous crime nor is it going to be the last. The world has seen instances like this irrespective of government and borders. We could remember few of them at least to remind us the level of cruelty humans can go for seeking the power. We haven't forgotten Holocaust of Nazi Germany, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing, the recent taliban government and many more which could not make it to news.</p>
                        <p>This is not just about the immorality and injustice with the women. The power game seems to be ignored. So the solution seems to be simple you grow in power, but the result would more often than not would be what is happening between Mietis and Kuki in Manipur.</p>
                        <p>The permanent solution is to drop the desire of power, but how many of us have such plans and even if we have such, can we trust that we won't be exploited. This is why I talked about the vicious cycle.</p>
                        <p>The new news will replace the old one. Slowly and gradually we will forget as all of us have our own battles to fight. However, I wish we would understand the root cause and will ask ourselves that do we want to wait till such incident reaches our door? One of the philosopher, Immanuel Kant, suggested that <em>you do to others what you expect them to do to yourself</em>. I hope we would soon understand what Kant was suggesting.</p>
