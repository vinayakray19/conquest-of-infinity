                <h2>Cricket and Lessons</h2>

                <div class="article-content">
<p>As a team sports fan in general and a die hard cricket fan in particular, the IPL 2020 in the time of pandemic has came as a joy for me. Till half way mark, some spectacular matches has been played. Out of all the league matches, two of them(RR vs KXIP and KXIP vs RCB) are mine favorite. Both matches coincidentally involves KXIP and both can be a great lesson for life.</p>
                        <p>Let me start with the RR vs KXIP. This match took place at the earlier stage of the tournament, when both the teams were playing good cricket and didn't had much pressure of playoffs. KXIP scored 226 in the first inning with a blistering knock of 106 by Mayank Agarwal. RR was struggling in the chase with around 80 to score in the last 5 overs. In a chase of 227 in a T20 game, Rahul Tewatia was having the strike rate of less than 90 after playing around 24 balls. The game seemed to be sleeping away from the RR. Meanwhile, Sanju Samson was striking the ball fairly well, so he decided to not take even single in the 15th over to make it large. Unfortunately Sanju got out under pressure and the entire world whoever was watching that match started to criticize Rahul Tewatia. In the last 3 overs RR needed 51 runs. Out of no expectations, Tewatia striked 5 balls out of the park in an over and the entire world including me started to praise him like nothing. Tewatia's inning helped the RR finally cross the line. Always a win for a side is a loss for the other and unfortunately KXIP landed on the other side.</p>
                        <p>This awesome game of 40 overs reminded me few very important lessons of life. First, human beings have nature to judge immediately. Second, you never know when things could suddenly change so just stand strong where you are. Third and the most important, the self confidence is a key driver to the long and tough way.</p>
                        <p>As Tewatia grew in confidence to it's peak, at the same time KXIP went into deep trouble. The confidence of KXIP kept on going down till match number 31. Now let me fast forward to match no 31(KXIP vs RCB).</p>
                        <p>KXIP placed at the bottom of the table with 6 losses out of 7 matches whereas RCB was placed comfortably at 2nd place with 5 wins in the 7 matches. A do or die kind of match for KXIP. As a cricket fan, one might not like to see KXIP at the bottom of table, because the two top run getters of the league were the openers of KXIP, yet they were not able to win the big moments. Fast forwarding the match to the 19th over of the second inning. KXIP needed 7 runs of 12 balls with 9 wickets in hand and the classic KL Rahul on crease with the Universe Boss Gayle. Both of them had scored fifty. Last over, KXIP needed just the 2 of 6, still KL and Gayle on the crease. Seemed like a cake walk for the players of this class.</p>
                        <p>But but but, when you are low on self confidence, no matter how well you have been in the past, the nerves gets so tensed that even the batters like KL Rahul and Gayle who could score 20 off 6 on their day were struggling to get 2 off 6. Finally the KXIP was able to score the final run on the last ball after a lot of drama in the last over. The kind of emotions that KL was having on his face after the win reflected a lot about the life in general.</p>
                        <p>Again this match came up with reminder of some basic lessons for life. First, Even the best could fail in the lack of confidence. Second, be aware as the chance of making mistakes is more during the phase of downturn. Third and the most important, no matter how long is the night but there will always be a dawn on the other end.</p>
                        <p>With the league at the half way mark, hope to see a great season with nail biting matches in later half of the league and hope that match number 31 will be the end of that long night and the dawn of the great journey of KXIP in IPL 2020.</p>
